# INTRODUCTION

This project looks at the decline in NBA Finals viewership over the years, with a particular focus on the growing reliance on three-point shots. For example, in 1998, the NBA Finals attracted an average of 29.04 million viewers, but by 2024, that number had fallen to just 11.31 million. In contrast, three-point attempts have seen a huge jump during the same period. Back in 1998, teams averaged only 5.8 three-point attempts per game, but by 2024, that number skyrocketed to 33.4—a nearly 5 time increase!

In the last decade, the NBA’s style of play has changed dramatically, with the three-point shot now driving most offensive strategies. While this shift has led to some exciting individual performances and new records, it has also sparked concerns about the direction of the game. Many fans feel that the heavy focus on three-point shooting has made the game more predictable and less exciting overall. Critics argue that it’s taken away from the balance, creativity, and team-oriented play that once made the NBA so appealing. This report will explore how the rise in three-point attempts, despite transforming the sport, may be a key factor in the decline of fan interest and TV ratings.

# VIEWERSHIP

To start this project, we have to find the data that shows the trend of the viewership. We were able to find one data from Wikipedia, which is the average final games views throughout the years. After wrangling the data, the data will show the viewership of the average final games from the year 1986 until 2024. After that, we plot the line graph to see whether the viewership is declining or not.

As we can see from the graph, it is declining. The peak views is 29.04 million in the year 1994 while the lowest views is 7.45 million in 2020. Now obviously in 2020, it was during COVID-19 pandemic that would cause the lower viewership. However, we would argue that even before COVID-19, there was a significant decline in viewership. Which means that there could be other factors that would cause this decline.

# THREE-POINTS SHOT ATTEMPTS

We have theorized that the amount of three-point shot attempts in the games would cause the increase in decline in the viewership. The reason why we say this is because people get bored of the gameplay because everytime the players trying to score points, they will attempt the three-point shot. This makes the game less exciting and predictable. It is different during the times where three-points shot were rarely attempted. A lot of variations that the players used to score points instead of just shooting at a long range. In Michael Jordan era for example, we can see that in Figure 1, in the year 19XX, we can see that the views are high, which we can conclude that people were excited to see the players play.

To confirm this theory, we gathered our data from Basketball Reference to see whether or not the three-points shot attempts is increasing throughout the years or remain constant. After cleaning the data, we implement the line graph to see the trends of three-points shot attempts.

We can see from the line graph that the three-points shot attempts increased drastically. Which would confirm our theory.

We have theorized on why three-points shot attempts keep increasing over time. The theory is that many players want to copy the star-player Stephen Curry, who is the goat of three-points shot. Ammar can continue/fix this essay

# CODE IMPLEMENTATION

## Three-Point Shot Attempts

### Data collection

The data was sourced from Basketball Reference, using the rvest library to scrape the statistics table. The raw data included league averages for various metrics per game for all seasons.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
url <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html"
nbaRawList <- read_html(x = url) %>%
  html_elements(css = "table") %>%
  html_table()

# View data
nbaLeagueAveragesRaw <- nbaRawList[[2]]
view(nbaLeagueAveragesRaw)
```

### Data wrangling

Using the tidyverse package, the data was processed as follows:

```         
i.  Renamed columns using the first row for better clarity.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: rename
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

mutate(Season = as.numeric(str_sub(Season, -2))
```

```         
ii. Filtered out unnecessary rows and restricted the dataset to seasons from 1980 onwards.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: filter
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

filter(MP != "Per Game", Season != "Season", Season >= 1980)
```

```         

iii. Converted the Season column into numeric format, distinguishing between 20th and 21st centuries.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: convert
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

mutate(
  Season = if_else(Season > 46, 1900 + Season, 2000 + Season),
  `FGA` = as.numeric(`FGA`),
  `3PA` = as.numeric(`3PA`),
  `PTS` = as.numeric(`PTS`)
)
```

```         

iv. Selected relevant columns: Season, FGA, 3PA, and PTS.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: select
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

select(
       "Season",
       "FGA",
       "3PA",
       "PTS"
       )
```

<!-- -->

### Challenges and Solutions

```         
i)  Issue: Handling ambiguous century notation in the Season column (e.g., "98" could mean 1998 or 2098).

    Solution: Assumed seasons with a value greater than 46 belong to the 20th century (1900s) and the rest to the 21st century (2000s).

ii) Issue: The presence of unwanted rows (e.g., headers repeated within the table).

Solution: Applied filter() to exclude rows containing "Per Game" or "Season".
```

### Result/Conclusion

The processed data revealed significant trends in NBA gameplay:

i)  A noticeable increase in three-point attempts (3PA) over time, indicating the league's shift toward perimeter shooting.

ii) Field goal attempts (FGA) and points scored (PTS) have also evolved, reflecting changes in game pace and scoring efficiency.

## NBA Finals Viewership

### Data collection

The data was sourced from Wikipedia, using the rvest library to scrape the statistics table. The raw data included the various tables including viewerships and ratings.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: load-packages2
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_television_ratings"
ratingViewershipDataset <- rvest::read_html(x = url) %>%
  html_elements(css = "table") %>%
  html_table()

# View data
ratingViewershipRaw <- ratingViewershipDataset[[4]]
view(ratingViewershipRaw)
```

### Data wrangling

Using the tidyverse package, the data was processed as follows:

```         
i.  Select the necessary attributes.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: select2
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

select(
    "Year",
    "Network",
    "Avg",
    "Game 1",
    "Game 2",
    "Game 3",
    "Game 4",
    "Game 5",
    "Game 6"
    )
```

```         
ii. Filtered out unnecessary rows and restricted the dataset to seasons from 1980 onwards.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: filter2
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

filter(as.numeric(Year) > 1985)
```

```         

iii. Changing the Viewership data from the unecessary data by removing it.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: convert2
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

mutate(
    Year = as.numeric(str_remove(Year, "\\[.*\\]")),
    AvgRating = str_extract(Avg, "^[^\\(]+"),
    AvgViews_M = str_extract(Avg, "\\(([^\\)]+)\\)") %>%
      str_remove_all("[\\(\\)]") %>%
      str_remove("M Viewers|MViewers|MHouseholds") %>%
      as.numeric()
  )
```

```         

iv. Selected relevant columns: Season, FGA, 3PA, and PTS.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| label: select3
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

select(
    Year,
    Network,
    AvgViews_M
  )
```

### Result/Conclusion

The processed data revealed significant trends in NBA Finals viewership:

i)  The decline in average viewership can be seen in the data
